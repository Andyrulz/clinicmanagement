## 🚀 How to Use

### For Doctors:

1. Navigate to Dashboard → Doctor Availability
2. Click "Add Availability" to create schedule blocks
3. Set time slots, duration, and capacity
4. View calendar to see generated time slots

### For Staff/Receptionists:

1. Access calendar view to see all doctor availability
2. Click on time slots to see booking details
3. Use booking interface (modal) to schedule patients

### For Admins:

1. Full access to all features
2. Can manage availability for all doctors
3. Access to management and analytics features

## 🔧 Key Features

### Availability Management

- **Flexible Scheduling**: Set availability by day of week with custom time ranges
- **Slot Configuration**: Configurable slot duration, buffer time, and patient capacity
- **Date Ranges**: Set effective from/until dates for temporary schedules
- **Types**: Regular, special, break, and unavailable slot types

### Calendar Views

- **Multiple Views**: Daily, weekly, and monthly calendar displays
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded availability and booking status
- **Interactive**: Click on slots for details and booking
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

### Booking System

- **Real-time Availability**: Dynamic slot availability checking
- **Capacity Management**: Multiple patients per slot with configurable limits
- **Visit Integration**: Linked with existing patient visit system
- **Cancellation**: Booking cancellation and slot release

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Database Functions

1. `generate_doctor_time_slots()` - Generate slots for a doctor within date range
2. `generate_slots_for_all_doctors()` - Bulk slot generation
3. `book_time_slot()` - Reserve a slot for a patient visit
4. `cancel_time_slot_booking()` - Cancel booking and free up slot
5. `get_available_slots()` - Query available slots with filtering

### Service Layer Methods

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete availability schedules
- **Slot Management**: Generate, book, cancel time slots
- **Analytics**: Availability statistics and utilization reports
- **Validation**: Data validation and business logic enforcement

### Component Architecture

- **Form Component**: React form with validation and error handling
- **Calendar Component**: Multiple view modes with interactive features
- **Dashboard Component**: Tabbed interface with role-based access
- **Modal System**: Slot details and booking interface

## 🔐 Security & Permissions

### Row Level Security (RLS)

- All tables have RLS policies enabled
- Tenant-based data isolation
- Role-based access control

### Permission Levels

- **Doctors**: Can manage their own availability
- **Staff**: Can view all availability and book slots
- **Admin**: Full access to all features
- **Managers**: Access to reports and bulk operations

## 🧪 Testing

### API Testing

Test the implementation using the API endpoint:

```
GET /api/availability?action=test
GET /api/availability?action=availabilities
GET /api/availability?action=stats
```

### Database Testing

Run the verification script:

```bash
node scripts/verify-schema.js
```

## 🔄 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Phase 2 Features

1. **Bulk Operations**: Import/export availability schedules
2. **Templates**: Save and reuse common schedule patterns
3. **Notifications**: Email/SMS notifications for schedule changes
4. **Mobile App**: Dedicated mobile interface for doctors
5. **Analytics Dashboard**: Advanced reporting and insights
6. **Integration**: Connect with external calendar systems

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Caching**: Redis caching for frequently accessed data
2. **Indexing**: Additional database indexes for query optimization
