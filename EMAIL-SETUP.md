# Email Setup Guide - Resend Integration

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Get Your Resend API Key

1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Go to [API Keys page](https://resend.com/api-keys)
4. Click "Create API Key"
5. Name it something like "CMS Development"
6. Copy the API key (starts with `re_`)

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables

1. Open your `.env.local` file
2. Replace `your_resend_api_key_here` with your actual API key:
   ```bash
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

### Step 3: Domain Setup (Optional for Development)

For production, you'll want to verify your domain:

1. Go to [Resend Domains](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Add your domain (e.g., `yourclinic.com`)
3. Update the `from` field in `/src/app/api/send-invitation/route.ts`

### Step 4: Test the System

1. Restart your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Create an invitation from your admin dashboard
3. Check that:
   - âœ… The link is auto-copied to clipboard
   - âœ… Email is sent (check recipient's inbox/spam)
   - âœ… Invitation link works when clicked
