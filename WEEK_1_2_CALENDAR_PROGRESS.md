## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Database Schema Enhancement**

```sql
-- Key additions to patient_visits table
ALTER TABLE patient_visits ADD COLUMN appointment_status TEXT DEFAULT 'scheduled';
ALTER TABLE patient_visits ADD COLUMN appointment_source TEXT DEFAULT 'manual';
ALTER TABLE patient_visits ADD COLUMN duration_minutes INTEGER DEFAULT 30;

-- New appointment_slots table for 15-minute precision
CREATE TABLE appointment_slots (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  doctor_id uuid NOT NULL,
  slot_date date NOT NULL,
  slot_time time NOT NULL,
  duration_minutes integer DEFAULT 15,
  is_booked boolean DEFAULT false,
  patient_id uuid REFERENCES patients(id)
);
```

### **Service Architecture**

```typescript
// AppointmentService integrates with existing systems
class AppointmentService {
  // Uses existing DoctorAvailabilityService for slot validation
  // Extends patient_visits table for appointment data
  // Maintains tenant isolation and RLS policies
  // Provides calendar event transformation
}
```

### **Component Structure**

```
